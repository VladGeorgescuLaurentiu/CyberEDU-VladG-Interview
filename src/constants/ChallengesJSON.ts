The authentication is unilateral, and works as follows:\n\n1.\tAlice requests access to the server by sending her username.\n2.\tThe server randomly selects 2 values index1 and index2 (1 <= index1 < index2 <= 64), and challenges Alice with (index1, index2).\n3.\tAlice applies SHA256 to her password, keeps the hex characters placed on the positions index1 and index2 unchanged and changes all the other hex characters to a different value. Then, she sends the result to the server.\n4.\tThe server receives the response, and checks if the received string equals the SHA256 value stored in the database for Alice\u2019s username in exactly two positions: index1 and index2. \n5.\tTo decrease the chances to obtain access by luck, the server repeats the procedure and sends several requests to Alice before allowing her to access the e-mail. If Alice replies correctly to all challenges, then she is successfully authenticated; if not, Alice is denied access.\n\nFor example:\n\n- username: Alice\n- password: ageneralpassword\n- SHA256(password) = aad3```e```da32ce777fa1cb3ca97ac7e1bfdd726053e05e0109b3526a63fed4```5```19b7\n- index1 = 5 and index2 = 60\n- Valid reply (only hex characters on positions 5 and 60 are unchanged):\n4c77```e```f3010c2f5c274ebbb0ff5abe001eeb5ce0f944dd1402caaf9ddx47```5```bffe \n- Invalid reply (hex characters on positions 9 and 57 are also the same):\n4c77```e```f30```2```0c2f5c274ebbb0ff5abe001eeb5ce0f944dd1402caaf9dd```e```47```5```bffe \n- Invalid reply (hex character on position 5 is different):\n4c77```f```f3010c2f5c274ebbb0ff5abe001eeb5ce0f944dd1402caaf9ddx47```5```bffe\n\nAn adversary masquerades the server, and fools Alice to reply to his challenges.
